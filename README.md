## Issues
Tests currently not working
  On firefox -

    Scenario - I want to edit the content of an existing Todo item
          Test - Should match the edited todo value

          It is editing the text but for some strange reason the library is not able to send the enter keys. Under investigation.-

    Scenario - I can clear a single Todo item from the list completely by clicking the Close icon
        The scenario is failing(https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/159) as to there is no implementation in firefox for the moveToObject command. Looking for alternate solution.-

Genuine failures.

    Scenario - I want to edit the content of an existing Todo item
          Test - Should update localStorage

          The app itself is not updating the local storage.
